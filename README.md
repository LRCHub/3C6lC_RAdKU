```lrc
[00:02.21] (Wanted, wanted)
[00:11.02] Alone, so alone that I could cry
[00:21.80] I want to be wanted (wanted)
[00:25.42] Alone, watching lovers passing by
[00:34.43] I want to be wanted
[00:43.93] 
[00:38.40] When I am kissed
[00:41.04] I want his lips to really kiss me
[00:45.36] When we're apart
[00:47.60] I want his heart to really miss me
[00:51.93] I want to know
[00:54.23] He loves me so his eyes are misty
[00:58.36] That's the way I want to be loved
[01:14.86] 
[01:04.63] Alone, just my lonely heart knows how
[01:14.36] I want to be wanted (wanted) right now
[01:21.21] Not tomorrow, but right now
[01:27.30] I want to be wanted
[01:36.80] 
[01:30.85] I want someone
[01:33.68] To share my laughter and my tears with
[01:38.99] Someone I know
[01:40.65] I'd love to spend a million years with
[01:45.25] Where is this someone somewhere meant for me?
[02:07.75] 
[01:57.95] (Alone) Just my lonely heart knows how
[02:07.15] I want to be wanted (right now)
[02:14.54] Not tomorrow, but right now
[02:20.58] I want to be wanted
[02:30.08] 
[02:24.84] I want someone
[02:27.41] To share my laughter and my tears with
[02:32.18] Someone I know
[02:33.52] I'd love to spend a million years with
[02:38.32] Where is this someone somewhere meant for me?
[02:49.54] (Someone, somewhere) Meant for me
